<div class="card-body"><p>Candidates fell into some broad categories on this question. This was a “show that” question, so there was an expectation of a mathematical argument. Many were able to successfully show that the initial and final kinetic energies were different and connect this to the concept of inelastic collisions. Some candidates tried to connect conservation of momentum unsuccessfully, and some simply wrote an extended response about the nature of inelastic collisions and noted that the bobs stuck together without any calculations. This approach was awarded zero marks.</p></div>
