<div class="card-body"><p>a) This was well answered with the majority converting to K. Quite a few found the number of moles but did not then convert to molecules.</p>
<p>bi) Well answered. It was pleasing to see how many recognised the need to state that the mass/number of molecules stayed the same as well as stating that the volume increased. At SL this recognition was less common so only 1 mark was often awarded.</p>
<p>bii) This was less successfully answered. A surprising number of candidates said that the internal energy of an ideal gas increases during an isothermal expansion. Many recognised that constant temp meant constant KE but then went on to state that the PE must increase and so the internal energy would increase.<br/><br/></p></div>
