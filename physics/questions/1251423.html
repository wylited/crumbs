<div class="card-body"><p>This question discriminated well at both HL and SL with many candidates choosing the correct option D. However, option B was also a popular choice particularly at SL. Candidates need to be aware that when performing a calculation e.g. the area as here, the uncertainty also has to be propagated - so a 5% uncertainty in the radius becomes a 10% uncertainty in the area. There were some comments on the G2s that the uncertainty should only have been given to 1sf but this is not always correct as uncertainties are given to the precision of the value, depending on the percentage calculated in the propagation.</p></div>
