<div class="card-body"><p>ai) On most occasions it looked like students knew more than they could successfully communicate. Lots of answers talked about interference between the 2 waves, or standing waves being produced but did not go on to add detail. Candidates should take note of how many marks the question part is worth and attempt a structure of the answer that accounts for that. At SL there were problems recognizing a standard question requiring the typical explanation of how a standing wave is established.</p>
<p>3aii) By far the most common answer was 2800 Hz, not doubling the value given to get the correct wavelength. That might suggest that some students misinterpreted adjacent minima as two troughs, therefore missing to use the information to correctly determine the wavelength as 0.24 m.</p>
<p>b) A question that turned out to be a good high level discriminator. Most candidates went for an answer that generally had everything at a lower intensity and didn't pick up on the relative amount of superposition. Those that did answer it very well, with very clear explanations, succeeded in recognizing that the nodes would be louder and the anti-nodes would be quieter than before.</p></div>
