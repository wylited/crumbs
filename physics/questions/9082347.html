<div class="card-body"><p>This was an "explain" questions, so examiners were looking for a clear discussion of the movement of speaker B creating a changing path difference between B and the microphone and A and the microphone. This path difference would lead to interference, and the examiners were looking for a connection between specific phase differences or path differences for maxima or minima. Some candidates were able to discuss basic concepts of interference (e.g. "there is constructive and destructive interference"), but failed to make clear connections between the physical situation and the given graph. A very common mistake candidates made was to think the question was about intensity and to therefore describe the decrease in peak height of the maxima on the graph. Another common mistake was to approach this as a Doppler question and to attempt to answer it based on the frequency difference of B.</p></div>
