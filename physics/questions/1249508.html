<div class="card-body"><p>Even though both difficulty and discrimination index are acceptable a significant number of candidates chose incorrect options B or D. The examiners appreciated that this was a challenging question which required some thought partly because it asked what is not an assumption. Candidates need to be aware that although questions are normally phased in a positive sense there will occasionally be ones like this and they need to hold the idea of 'not' when looking at the possible answers. A useful strategy is to look for correct assumptions and when those are identified there should be just one left — the required answer.</p></div>
